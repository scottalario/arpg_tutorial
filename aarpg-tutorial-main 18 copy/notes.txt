Episode 47 - Enemy Obstacle Avoidance and Pathfinding
-----------------------------------------------------

Goal: Create a node that will help our enemies navigate around obstacles (and eachother),
WITHOUT using the pathfinding system.

Requirements:
	1) Standalone node does most the work
	2) No use of Pathfinding or Navigation nodes ( because I'm stubborn and weird )
	3) Enemies avoid bumping into walls AND other enemies
	4) Simple integration into chase state with minimal code changes
